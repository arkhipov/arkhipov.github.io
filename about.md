I am a technical lead and senior-level Java software engineer with over 12 years of experience in application design,
development and testing using Java, PostgreSQL and Linux. I have always been driven by a passion to create innovative,
optimized, scalable and reliable solutions. I am an avid open source proponent and contributor who loves robust and
clean code and design. You can find a bit more bragging about myself [here](/cv).

On a more personal note, I live in [Irkutsk, Russia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Irkutsk,+Irkutsk+Oblast,+Russia/){:.location},
a small beautiful town overlooking Lake Baikal. I have quite a number of hobbies and interests which include running,
cycling, solving math problems and learning languages (so if you are interested in a Russian-English language exchange,
feel free to [skype](skype:Pbl6aKuT?call){:.skype} me). I am also a bit of a bookworm and enjoy a good read.
